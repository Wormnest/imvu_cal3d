=====================================

This python script is intended for Blender version 2.63 or higher.
It is intended for exporting blender objects to Cal3d, more specifically
for IMVU.

To install this script you have to copy the entire folder called
io_export_cal3d_IMVU to your blender version's addons folder.
You need to go to this folder:
 AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation\Blender\<your Blender version>\scripts\addons
Where AppData is located depends on your Windows version. If you don't
know where to find it search on the internet, there are loads of tutorials
available.
Drop the entire io_export_cal3d_IMVU folder inside the addons folder.

Then you need to install the script in Blender. Start Blender, go to menu File, User Preferences.
Choose Import-Export, then browse to IMVU Cal3d export and check it. Next click Save As Default.

To export select your bones and mesh, then go to menu File, Export, IMVU Cal3d export.
The default settings should generally be fine for IMVU.
